This project is part of *This Is Our Code Club* \- a campaign from the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help every Code Club in the UK share its story. The goal is to produce a creative, personal artefact \- a podcast episode \- generated by an AI tool called **NotebookLM**. 

## What you will do

Your club members will reflect on what Code Club means to them. You’ll collect their stories, and feed them into NotebookLM as `.txt` files. The LLM will then generate an authentic-sounding podcast using their names and reflections: something that feels polished, personal, and shareable.

Your creators can find the project resources with instructions and writing prompts on the Code Club Project site at [rpf.io/ccpodcast](http://rpf.io/ccpodcast).  

### Data Protection and Safeguarding

**NotebookLM** (Google Labs) works with your uploaded documents but **does not** train on them or share them externally. Still, safeguarding is your responsibility as a club leader.

**Your responsibilities:**
* Use **first names only**  
* Remove addresses, location data, or personal contact info  
* Review and clean up all `.txt` files before upload
