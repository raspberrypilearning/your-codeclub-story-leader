## Support Creator Writing
Great AI outputs depend on strong source inputs. Your job is to help your coders express themselves naturally and clearly.

**What you need:**
* Creators’ first names  
* An ‘About me’ section (no identifying information)  
* 2 or 3 personal writing answers using prompts below

**What works best for prompted writing:**
* Short personal reflections  
* Informal tone (like they’re talking, not writing an essay - tips on text-to-speech tools below)  
* Specific anecdotes or club moments  
* Fun, expressive, weird - whatever reflects your club and creators best

### Included writing prompts:
* What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever made in our Code Club?  
* What makes our Code Club different from any other?  
* If our Code Club had a motto or catchphrase, what would it be and why?  
* Who are the characters in our club story? (people, inside jokes, traditions, mascots)  
* What’s one day in Code Club that stands out? Why?  
* If you were introducing our Code Club to someone on a podcast, what story would you tell?  
* How do you feel when you walk into our Code Club space?

### Speech-to-text support

You can use free, no sign-up online tools to transcribe creator’s speech, like:

* [Galaxy.ai](https://galaxy.ai/ai-transcription)  
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/ai-transcribe)

Paste the output of these tools into your creators’ text files for a more natural and conversational (but definitely louder!) club session.

### Process for student `.txt` files:
1. Using the local text editor software on your computers or devices (or accessible cloud alternative - google docs, teams, office365, editpad), each creator answers 2-3 of the [project](http://rpf.io/ccpodcast) prompts and types their answers into a `.txt` file.  
2. Save each file with the creator’s first name: `ava.txt`  
   * You could also combine all student stories into one `codeclub_reflections.txt` file, if it's easier for you.  
3. Collect all the files into one folder, either online or on a USB.

First name: Ava

About me:  
I’ve been coming to Scriptville Code Club for about six months. I like building games in Scratch and helping other people when they’re stuck.

Our Code Club:  
We always start with a joke from our leader. There’s usually biscuits. I sit next to Theo and we try to outdo each other’s projects.

A day I remember:  
One time I accidentally deleted my project and had to rebuild it from memory. It ended up better than the original. I showed my grandma and she said it was brilliant!

When I walk into our club space: 
I feel excited and happy, like something fun is about to happen.
