## Support Creator Writing
Great AI outputs depend on strong source inputs. Your job is to help your coders express themselves naturally and clearly.

You can pre-select a few of the writing prompts on this page, or just let your creators choose the ones that inspire them the most.

Support your creators to open the text editing software for your operating system:

Choose your device to find out how to open a plain text editor on your computer:

Open the application menu and search for `Leafpad` or `Gedit`.

If your device doesn’t have these apps installed, you can use a website like [https://editpad.org](https://editpad.org) — just remember to download your file as `.txt` when you’re done.

### Writing prompts:

--- task ---

Choose a few of these prompts for your creators to use:

- What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever made in our Code Club?  
- What makes our Code Club different from any other?  
- If our Code Club had a motto or catchphrase, what would it be and why?  
- Who are the characters in our club story? (people, inside jokes, traditions, mascots)  
- What’s one day in Code Club that stands out? Why?  
- If you were introducing our Code Club to someone on a podcast, what story would you tell?  
- How do you feel when you walk into our Code Club space?

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Using the chosen text editor software, each creator answers 2-3 of the [project](http://rpf.io/ccpodcast) prompts and types their answers into a `.txt` file.  

**What works best for prompted writing:**
* Short personal reflections or anecdotes
* Informal, natural tone (like they’re talking, not writing an essay - tips on text-to-speech tools below)  
* Specific stories or club moments  
* Fun, expressive, weird - whatever reflects your club and creators best

--- /task ---

### Speech-to-text support

You can use free, no sign-up online tools to transcribe creator’s speech, like:

* [Galaxy.ai](https://galaxy.ai/ai-transcription)  
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/ai-transcribe)

Paste the output of these tools into your creators’ text files for a more natural and conversational (but definitely louder!) club session.

### Processing student `.txt` files:

--- task ---

Make sure that your creators have everything they need in their `.txt` files before saving them.

**Each document should have:**
* Creators’ first names  
* An ‘About me’ section (no identifying information)  
* 2 or 3 personal writing answers using prompts

--- /task ---

**Example txt file:**

```
First name: Ava

About me:  
I’ve been coming to Scriptville Code Club for about six months. I like 
building games in Scratch and helping other people when they’re stuck.

Our Code Club:  
We always start with a joke from our leader. There’s usually biscuits. 
I sit next to Theo and we try to outdo each other’s projects.

A day I remember:  
One time I accidentally deleted my project and had to rebuild it from 
memory. It ended up better than the original. I showed my grandma and 
she said it was brilliant!

When I walk into our club space: 
I feel excited and happy, like something fun is about to happen.
```

Save each file with the creator’s first name: `ava.txt`. 

(You could also combine all student stories into one `codeclub_reflections.txt` file, if it's easier for you.)

Collect all the files into one folder, ready to upload to NotebookLM.
