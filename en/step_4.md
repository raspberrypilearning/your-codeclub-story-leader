Once your podcast episode has been generated in NotebookLM, it’s time to share it!

NotebookLM lets you share your finished notebook (including the podcast) using a public link. This means that anyone with the link can ask questions about your code club to the LLM and get a response based on your creators’ words, or listen to your podcast\!
