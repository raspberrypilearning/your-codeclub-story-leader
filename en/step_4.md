## Unplugged Activity: LLM Storytime

While you wait for the LLM to create your new podcast, play a fun Unplugged game with your creators where they use dice to make crazy stories, and learn a little bit about how LLMs create sentences.

The creator handout is [available here as a printable PDF](resources/LLMStorytime_creator.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and a printable PDF for running the unplugged activity with discussion prompts is [available here](resources/LLMStorytime_leader.pdf).

### **Overview:**

You're training an AI system called an **LLM** that uses your stories to answer questions, and make a podcast with AI voices. But an LLM like NotebookLM doesn‚Äôt actually think, or understand *anything*: it just guesses what seems like it should come next in a sentence.

The higher the ‚Äútemperature‚Äù set for the LLM, the wilder its guesses get. Use dice rolls to control the **temperature** of a story and see what your LLM comes up with!

### **You‚Äôll Need:**
- 6 sided dice ([or make your own from paper here](resources/dice.pdf){:target="_blank"})
- Pencils
- Creator handout ([available here](resources/LLMStorytime_creator.pdf){:target="_blank"})

### Generate a Story like an LLM

--- task ---

**Set the Temperature**

Choose which table to use by rolling the dice:

* 1-2 \= Low (predictable and safe)  
* 3-4 \= Medium (balanced and interesting)  
* 5-6 \= High (random and wild)

This determines which table you should use below when creating your stories.

**Generate a Story**

In a \[**adjective**\] \[**place**\], a \[**person**\] found a \[**adjective**\] \[**thing**\].  
Curious, they tried to \[**verb**\] it, but that only made things \[**adjective**\].  
Moments later, something \[**adjective**\] happened when a \[**adjective**\] \[**person**\] appeared and had to \[**verb**\] it immediately\!

Roll the dice for each blank and look up your words on the table below. 
Your total determines the row (1‚Äì6) from the word table. Higher rolls \= stranger words.

### **Discussion**

--- task ---

**Ask: What‚Äôs the weirdest verb (doing word) you can think of?ü§î**

It‚Äôs pretty hard to do! Take some examples and ask ‚Äòwhat makes it *weird‚Äô*?

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Ask: Who would like to share a ‚Äòlow-temperature story‚Äô?** 

	Take examples of a low-temperature story. Note how ‚Äònormal‚Äô the inserted words are. The story probably won‚Äôt be too crazy.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Ask: Who would like to share a ‚Äòmedium-temperature story‚Äô?** 

	Take examples of a low-temperature story. Note how the inserted words are a bit more interesting. The story probably sounded like it might be interesting if we used it as a prompt for something bigger.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Ask: Who would like to share a ‚Äòhigh-temperature story‚Äô?** 

	Take examples of a high-temperature story. Note how ‚Äòweird‚Äô the inserted words are. The story probably won‚Äôt make a lot of sense or will be really crazy.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Ask: How does temperature affect the story our pretend LLM generated?** 

When you talk about the ‚Äòtemperature‚Äô of an LLM like ChatGPT, what you‚Äôre really talking about is how random and strange the words it will use are. Lower temperature means it will use more likely and ‚Äònormal‚Äô words in your output, while high temperature means weirder, less likely words.
